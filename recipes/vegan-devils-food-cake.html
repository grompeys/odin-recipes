            <li>6 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cups cake flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups water</li>
            <li>⅔ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>

                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>
                    Melt unsweetened chocolate in top of a double boiler over
                    simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the
                    sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Set aside to
                    cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two
                    9-inch cake pans with waxed paper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>
                    Sift cake flour, baking soda, and salt together in a large
                    bowl.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p>
                    Whisk sugar, water, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and
                    balsamic vinegar in a large bowl until well-combined. Stir
                    in half of the sifted flour mixture. Fold in melted
                    chocolate. Stir in remaining sifted flour mixture. Beat with
                    an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is smooth,
                    about 2 minutes. Divide batter between cake pans.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 5</h4>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until toothpicks inserted in the
                    centers come out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pans,
                    5 minutes. Invert cakes onto wire rack and let cool
                    completely before frosting, about 1 hour.
