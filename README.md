Project: Recipes
Foundations Course of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)  
[Instructions](https://theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

## Assignment

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure

1. [x] Create the **odin-recipes** directory

1. [x] Within the `/odin-recipes`, create an **index.html** file

1. [x] Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an **h1** heading “Odin Recipes” to the body

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page

1. [x] Create a new directory within `/odin-recipes` and name it **recipes**.

1. [x] Create a new HTML file within `/odin-recipes` and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example **lasagna.html**. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can [find a recipe to use here](https://www.allrecipes.com/).

1. [x] For now, just include an **h1** heading with the recipe’s name as its content.

1. [x] Back in the **index.html** file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

The recipe page should have the following content:

1. [x] An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or the [recipe site](https://www.allrecipes.com/) we linked to earlier.

1. [x] Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.

1. [x] Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.

1. [x] Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Directions” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

1. [x] Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.

1. [x] Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.

### Iteration 5: Add Style

1. [] Add css
